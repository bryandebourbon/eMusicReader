## Development preview

To preview the `index.html` file from any branch on GitHub, you can use
[HTMLPreview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) by substituting your repository
URL and branch name:

```
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<USER>/<REPO>/<BRANCH>/index.html
```

Replace `<USER>`, `<REPO>` and `<BRANCH>` with the appropriate values to get a
clickable link for testing a pull request.

## Touch Support

You can swipe across the staffs on mobile devices to select a phrase. When you lift your finger, all matching phrases in the score will be highlighted.


## Page Navigation

Scrolling is disabled so swipe gestures work reliably. Use the new left and right arrows to move between pages. Each page spans exactly one screen height.

## Auto Scroll

Use the new Auto Scroll button in the top toolbar to keep the currently playing staff centered while playback is running.

## Progressive Web App

This site now includes a web manifest and service worker so it can be installed on mobile and desktop browsers. Add it to your home screen to use it like a native app.
