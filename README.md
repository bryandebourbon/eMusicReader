## Development preview

To preview the `index.html` file from any branch on GitHub, you can use
[HTMLPreview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) by substituting your repository
URL and branch name:

```
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<USER>/<REPO>/<BRANCH>/index.html
```

Replace `<USER>`, `<REPO>` and `<BRANCH>` with the appropriate values to get a
clickable link for testing a pull request.

All pull request descriptions will include this link automatically with the
correct branch name, making it easy to preview changes directly from the PR.
