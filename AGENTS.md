Instructions
------------
- After creating the PR, include the HTML preview link below in the description.
- The link must point to the branch name returned by `container.make_pr` (e.g. `codex/add-ties-and-slurs-back-kvbg0h`).
- Example format:
  https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandebourbon/eMusicReader/<branch>/index.html
  Replace `<branch>` with that final PR branch. Do **not** use the local `work` branch name.
- Wait until the branch name is known so the link contains the correct path.
