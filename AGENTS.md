Instructions
-----------
- Include the following HTML preview link in every pull request description **after** the branch has been created:
  https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandebourbon/eMusicReader/codex/<branch>/index.html
  Replace `<branch>` with the actual branch name Codex generates for the PR.
  Wait until that name is available so the link contains the correct branch instead of a blank placeholder.
