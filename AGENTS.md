Instructions
-----------
Every pull request description **must** include the HTML preview link *after* Codex creates the branch:
  https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandebourbon/eMusicReader/codex/<branch>/index.html
Replace `<branch>` with the exact PR branch name, waiting until that name is known so the link is correct and never a placeholder.

Example for a branch named `add-ties-and-slurs-back-kvbg0h`:
  https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryandebourbon/eMusicReader/codex/add-ties-and-slurs-back-kvbg0h/index.html
